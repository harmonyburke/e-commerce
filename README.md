## Description

I created this application to help users write their database for their business. This application helps track the different categories, products, and tags a retailer would need to organize their inventory.


## Installation
Install all NPM packages(npm install). To seed the database and give a base to work from, run 'npm run seed'. Once everything is installed and seeded, run 'npm start' and navigate to insomnia to use this database.

## Usage
To use this database in insomia, pick your method (GET, POST, PUT, OR DELETE) and enter the required params to help you add/update/view or delete products, categories, or tags!


## Credits
I used the coursework from week 13 for reference on this projects, as well as help from my tutor Josshy Olea.
